# 1. The Flat has the following attributes:

# bed_rooms: a list of all the bedrooms in the house, initialize as empty list
# bath_rooms: a list of all the bathrooms in the house, initialize as empty list
# kitchens: a list of all the kitchens in the house, initialize as empty list
# owner_name: name of the flat owner, initialize as None
# current_renter: name of the current renter, initialize as None


# 2. The Flat Object supports the following methods:

# rent_out(): Checks if flat is already on rent, if not then it returns the rent of the flat which is calculated as 5*carpet_area per month. Then it asks the user whether they agree to pay that amount or not using input(), if they say Y/Yes/yes then take another input() as their name and set the current_renter attribute.

# PS: carpet area of the flat is the sum of carpet area of all the rooms in the house.
# change_owner(): Takes a name as input from the user and changes the owner of the flat to that person


# from bedroom import Bedroom
