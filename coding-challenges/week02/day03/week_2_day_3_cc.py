# 1. Write python program to ask a user's name, age and telephone number
# and welcome the user.

user1 = input("Enter your user name: ")
user2 = input("Enter your age: ")
user3 = input("Enter your telephone number: ")
print(user1)
print(user2)
print(user3)
print(user1, "Welcome to the world of python programming.")

# 2. Given 2 numbers as input from the user, find their sum and print it.

num1 = input("Enter 1st number: ")
num2 = input("Enter 2nd number: ")
total = (num1 + num2)
print("Total sum of string is: ",total)

# (If we take the number as input, we will get the answer in the form of a string.)
