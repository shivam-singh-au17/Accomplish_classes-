                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a curious boy who loves to wander around to create memories and learn new things. More than
                    destinations; I love
                    meeting people and indulge in heartfelt conversations. I find joy in all the small things in life.
                    Sometimes an exchange
                    of smile with a stranger can uplift my mood. Emotions run high in my life. So, I do tend to get very
                    emotional (a bit
                    too much) about the places I like and people I love. A hopeless romantic by nature, this curious boy
                    doesn’t endorse any
                    rude behaviour from anyone. And, hey…I prefer the countryside anytime over cities, anywhere in the
                    world.</p>
