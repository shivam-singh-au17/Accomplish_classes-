Question 1. Write short note on Process Life cycle (3 marks)

"""




"""
Process life cycle in OS is one of the five states in which a process can be 
starting from the time it has been submitted for execution, till the time when it
 has been executed by the system. A process can be in any of the following states 

1. New state
2. Ready state
3. Running state
4. Waiting state
5. Terminated

Process Cycle 1     ->   	New State
Process Cycle 2     ->   	Read State
Process Cycle 3     ->   	Running State
Process Cycle 4     ->   	Waiting State
Process Cycle 4     ->   	Terminated State

Question 2. What role does an operating system perform. (3 marks)

"""




"""
An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the 
computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows
 you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.
  Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

"""
Question 3. What is a process ? (3 marks)

"""




"""
In computing, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one 
or many threads. It contains the program code and its activity. Depending on the operating 
system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute 
instructions concurrently.

"""
Question 4. What is the job of a long term scheduler (3 marks)

"""


"""
It is also called a job scheduler. A long-term scheduler determines which programs are 
admitted to the system for processing. It selects processes from the queue and loads them 
into memory for execution. Process loads into the memory for CPU scheduling.


The primary objective of the job scheduler is to provide a balanced mix of jobs, such as I/O
 bound and processor bound. It also controls the degree of multiprogramming. If the degree of 
 multiprogramming is stable, then the average rate of process creation must be equal to the 
 average departure rate of processes leaving the system.



1	It is a job scheduler
2	Speed is lesser than short term scheduler
3	It controls the degree of multiprogramming
4	It is almost absent or minimal in time sharing system
5	It selects processes from pool and loads them into memory for execution

"""
Question 5. What is Response time. (3 marks)

"""




"""
Response time is the time spent between the ready state and getting the CPU for the first
 time. But the waiting time is the total time taken by the process in the ready state.
